  <p> I have three cats and I love them a lot and their unique prints. I also like sushi and springrolls. My parents are
    from Ecuador and I have one older brother. Right now in high school im taking re-engineering, its pretty hard doing
    the labs. Science is one of my hardests subjects in school right now, like I'm struggling bad. Now I have to do 60
    hours in order to graduate and get my endorsement, so I guess its a bit stressful, trying to manage all of my
    classes and my AP class too.</p>
  <!-- 5. After the third sentence in your bio, add a break tag. -->
